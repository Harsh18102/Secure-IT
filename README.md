# Secure-IT

Secure IT is a web-based application designed to enhance file encryption and decryption processes while streamlining user authentication. This project tackles the problem of securing sensitive data and ensuring communication privacy through the implementation of advanced encryption algorithms. It provides a reliable platform for end-to-end encryption, ensuring that confidential information is protected from unauthorized access.

Functions
  Encryption: Encrypts user messages with a secret key using strong encryption algorithms.
  Decryption: Decrypts the encrypted message with the same secret key.
  Password Strength Checker: Analyzes the strength of user passwords and categorizes them as weak, moderate, or strong.
  Random Password Generator: Generates new strong passwords with the given constraints.

Technologies Used
  Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  Backend: Python (Flask)
  Cryptography: Fernet Cryptography, AES-256, HMAC-SHA256

Requirements
  Python
  Flask
  HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  Cryptography library (Fernet encryption)
  AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
